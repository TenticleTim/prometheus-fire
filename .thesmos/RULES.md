<!-- THESMOS:GENERATED START rules -->
## All Rules

| ID | Category | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ENV_001 | `direct_env_access` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Use bracket-notation env access — process['env' as 'env']['VAR'] — never process.env.VAR dot notation. |
| SEC_001 | `admin_client_in_browser` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Never import the Supabase admin client in 'use client' files. Admin clients expose service-role keys to the browser. |
| SEC_002 | `rls_disabled` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Never disable Row Level Security. All Supabase tables must have RLS enabled with explicit policies. |
| SEC_003 | `secret_in_diff` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Never commit secrets, API keys, or private key material in code or config files. |
| AUTH_001 | `missing_api_auth` | 🟠 HIGH | All POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE API routes must verify caller identity before executing mutations. |
| TS_001 | `any_type_no_comment` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Avoid TypeScript `any` without an explanatory comment. Use `unknown` and narrow the type instead. |
| QUAL_001 | `console_log` | 🔵 LOW | Remove console.log statements before merging. Use structured logging in production code. |
| QUAL_002 | `large_file` | ⚪ TECH_DEBT | Files exceeding the configured line threshold are tech-debt candidates. Consider splitting into smaller modules. |
| GATE_001 | `monday_write_no_gate` | 🟠 HIGH | Monday.com write mutations must go through the designated gateway module, not scattered across the codebase. |
| TEST_001 | `missing_test_for_risky_change` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Risky file changes (matching riskyFilePatterns) must include a corresponding test file change in the same diff. |
| DS_001 | `design_system_bypass` | 🔵 LOW | Hardcoded colour literals or raw CSS values outside design-system files bypass the design token system. |
| COMP_001 | `duplicate_component_pattern` | ⚪ TECH_DEBT | Creating a component that duplicates an existing shared UI component. Reuse or extend instead. |
| SEC_004 | `eval_usage` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Never use eval() or new Function(string). Both execute arbitrary code and open remote code execution vulnerabilities. |

| SEC_011 | `math_random_crypto` | 🟠 HIGH | Math.random() is not cryptographically secure. Never use it for tokens, passwords, session IDs, or security-sensitive values. |
| SEC_012 | `cookie_no_flags` | 🟠 HIGH | Cookies set without httpOnly, secure, and sameSite flags are vulnerable to XSS theft and CSRF. |
| SEC_013 | `json_parse_user_input` | 🟡 MEDIUM | JSON.parse on user-supplied input without try-catch causes unhandled exceptions on malformed JSON. |
| SEC_014 | `ssrf_fetch` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Server-side fetch with a user-controlled URL enables SSRF — attackers can reach internal services. |
| SEC_015 | `open_redirect` | 🟠 HIGH | redirect() or res.redirect() with user-controlled input enables open redirect attacks. |
| SEC_016 | `shell_injection` | 🔴 BLOCKER | child_process.exec / execSync with template literals or concatenation enables command injection. |

| AUTH_003 | `localstorage_token` | 🟠 HIGH | Storing auth tokens in localStorage exposes them to XSS. Use httpOnly cookies managed by the server. |
| AUTH_004 | `user_id_from_body` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Trusting userId from req.body instead of the session allows users to act as any other user. |
| AUTH_005 | `missing_rate_limit` | 🟠 HIGH | Auth endpoints (login, register, password reset) without rate limiting are brute-force targets. |
| AUTH_006 | `hardcoded_credentials` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Hardcoded test credentials or default passwords in non-test files are a persistent security risk. |
| AUTH_007 | `missing_auth_middleware` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Admin or internal routes exposed without authentication middleware are world-accessible. |
| SEC_020 | `open_redirect` | 🟠 HIGH | Redirecting to a URL from user input without validation allows attackers to redirect users to phishing sites. |
| SEC_021 | `mass_assignment` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Spreading user input directly into database operations allows attackers to set fields they shouldn't control. |
| SEC_022 | `cors_wildcard_header` | 🔴 BLOCKER | CORS Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * allows any website to make credentialed requests to your API. |
| SEC_023 | `timing_attack_comparison` | 🟠 HIGH | Comparing secrets with === is vulnerable to timing attacks — use crypto.timingSafeEqual instead. |
| SEC_024 | `insecure_deserialization` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Deserializing untrusted data with eval(), new Function(), or JSON.parse without schema validation is dangerous. |

| SEC_033 | `xss_via_href` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Using user-provided URLs in href attributes allows javascript: protocol XSS attacks. |
| SEC_034 | `clickjacking_missing` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Pages without X-Frame-Options or CSP frame-ancestors are vulnerable to clickjacking. |
| SEC_035 | `password_not_hashed` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Storing passwords without hashing exposes all user credentials if the database is breached. |
| SEC_036 | `env_var_logged` | 🟠 HIGH | Logging process.env values risks exposing secret keys in log aggregators. |
| SEC_037 | `prototype_pollution_merge` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Object.assign() or lodash.merge() with user-controlled keys can pollute Object.prototype. |
| SEC_038 | `cors_reflected_origin` | 🔴 BLOCKER | CORS origin reflected from request header without allowlist — any origin can make credentialed cross-origin requests. |
| SEC_039 | `cors_wildcard_with_credentials` | 🔴 BLOCKER | CORS allows wildcard origin (*) combined with credentials:true — credentials are never sent with wildcard but this signals a misconfiguration. |
| SEC_040 | `cors_regex_allowlist` | 🟠 HIGH | CORS allowlist uses regex pattern matching instead of exact string comparison — regex bypass risk. |
| SEC_041 | `cors_null_origin` | 🟠 HIGH | CORS allowlist includes "null" origin — allows requests from file:// and sandboxed iframes. |
| SEC_042 | `cors_in_route_handler` | 🟠 HIGH | CORS headers set inside individual route handlers instead of global middleware — inconsistent coverage. |
| SEC_043 | `cors_long_preflight_cache` | 🟡 MEDIUM | CORS preflight max-age exceeds 1 week — permission changes take days to propagate. |
| SEC_044 | `ssrf_private_ip_range` | 🔴 BLOCKER | HTTP request to a URL that may resolve to a private IP range — SSRF to internal services. |
| SEC_045 | `path_traversal_encoding_bypass` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Path validation uses string comparison without URL-decoding first — encoding bypass (..%2F..%2F). |
| TS_002 | `ts_ignore_no_comment` | 🟡 MEDIUM | @ts-ignore suppresses TypeScript errors without explaining why. Always add a justification comment. |
| TS_003 | `ts_expect_error_no_comment` | 🔵 LOW | @ts-expect-error without an explanation comment obscures intentional type suppressions. |
| TS_004 | `non_null_user_input` | 🟠 HIGH | Non-null assertion (!) on req.query, req.params, or req.body values hides runtime crashes. |
| TS_005 | `double_cast` | 🟡 MEDIUM | `as unknown as T` double casts bypass TypeScript's type system entirely. This masks type errors. |
| TS_006 | `function_type` | 🔵 LOW | Using `Function` as a type is too broad — it accepts any callable including constructors with wrong signatures. |
| TS_007 | `var_declaration` | 🔵 LOW | `var` has function scope and hoisting behavior that causes subtle bugs. Use `const` or `let`. |
| TS_008 | `empty_catch_block` | 🟠 HIGH | Empty catch blocks swallow errors silently. At minimum, log the error. |
| TS_009 | `number_parse_no_validate` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Number() and parseInt() on user input return NaN for non-numeric strings. Always validate after parsing. |
| TS_010 | `floating_promise` | 🟠 HIGH | Calling an async function without await or .catch() creates an unhandled promise rejection. |
| TS_011 | `debugger_statement` | 🟠 HIGH | `debugger` statement committed to source code pauses execution in any environment with dev tools open. |
| TS_012 | `unhandled_error_in_catch` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Using catch(err) with `console.error` only and no re-throw or user notification swallows errors. |
| ASYNC_001 | `await_in_foreach` | 🟠 HIGH | `await` inside `.forEach()` does not wait for promises — use `for...of` or `Promise.all` instead. |
| ASYNC_002 | `promise_all_no_catch` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Promise.all() rejects immediately when any promise rejects — handle rejections explicitly. |
| ASYNC_003 | `async_no_try_catch` | 🟡 MEDIUM | API route handlers that are async and use await without try-catch let errors crash the process. |
| ASYNC_004 | `new_promise_constructor` | 🔵 LOW | `new Promise()` wrapping an already-async function loses error propagation and adds unnecessary indirection. |
| ASYNC_005 | `sequential_await` | 🔵 LOW | Multiple sequential awaits for independent operations — use Promise.all for parallel execution. |
| ASYNC_006 | `settimeout_zero` | 🔵 LOW | setTimeout(fn, 0) is a code smell — it defers execution to next tick to work around a timing bug. |
| TS_013 | `type_assertion_double_cast` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Double type assertion (x as unknown as T) is a red flag that the types are fundamentally incompatible. |
| TS_014 | `missing_return_type` | 🔵 LOW | Exported functions without explicit return types make API contracts unclear and allow accidental type widening. |
| TS_015 | `generic_constraint_missing` | 🔵 LOW | Generic type parameters without constraints (<T>) accept any type, defeating the purpose of generics. |
| TS_016 | `optional_chain_without_fallback` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Optional chaining (a?.b) returning undefined in places that expect a value causes silent runtime failures. |
| TS_017 | `non_null_assertion_overuse` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Excessive non-null assertions (!) hide null-reference errors that would otherwise be caught at compile time. |
| TS_018 | `discriminated_union_missing` | 🔵 LOW | Using string/boolean flags to model variants instead of discriminated unions makes impossible states possible. |
| TS_019 | `object_destructure_unused` | 🔵 LOW | Destructuring many properties but using only one is wasteful — destructure only what you need. |
| TS_020 | `template_literal_type_missing` | 🔵 LOW | Using string for URL paths, event names, or CSS classes loses IDE autocomplete and typo safety. |
| TS_021 | `readonly_missing` | 🔵 LOW | Config objects and DTO props without readonly can be accidentally mutated by consumers. |
| TS_022 | `enum_prefer_const_object` | 🔵 LOW | TypeScript enums should be replaced with as const objects for better tree-shaking and bundler compatibility. |
| TS_023 | `type_predicate_missing` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Type narrowing functions without type predicates (x is Type) don't narrow the type in the calling scope. |
| TS_024 | `satisfies_operator_missing` | 🔵 LOW | Using as Type instead of satisfies Type loses excess property checking and auto-inference of literal types. |
| TS_025 | `index_signature_unsafe` | 🔵 LOW | Index signatures (Record<string, T>) skip excess property checking and allow any string key. |
| TS_026 | `mapped_type_opportunity` | 🔵 LOW | Repeating the same property pattern across multiple types is a signal for a mapped type. |
| TS_027 | `string_union_too_wide` | 🔵 LOW | String union types with 10+ members become hard to maintain — consider using a const array and typeof. |
| TS_028 | `infer_keyword_avoid` | 🔵 LOW | Overusing conditional types with infer makes code unreadable — prefer utility types when possible. |
| TS_029 | `namespace_avoid` | 🔵 LOW | TypeScript namespaces (namespace Foo {}) are legacy — use ES modules (import/export) instead. |
| TS_030 | `excessive_type_assertion` | 🟡 MEDIUM | More than 5 type assertions in a single file indicates underlying type errors being suppressed rather than fixed. |
| REACT_001 | `useeffect_async_callback` | 🟠 HIGH | useEffect does not support async callbacks directly. The cleanup function must be synchronous. |
| REACT_002 | `key_prop_index` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Using array index as React key causes incorrect reconciliation when the list order changes. |
| REACT_003 | `direct_dom_manipulation` | 🟡 MEDIUM | document.getElementById and querySelector in React components bypass the virtual DOM. |
| REACT_004 | `window_ssr_unsafe` | 🟠 HIGH | Accessing `window` at the module or component level breaks server-side rendering. |
| REACT_005 | `state_mutation` | 🟠 HIGH | Mutating state arrays or objects directly (push, splice, sort) bypasses React's change detection. |
| REACT_006 | `react_fc_type` | 🔵 LOW | `React.FC` is discouraged — it implicitly adds children and hides component return type issues. |
| REACT_007 | `inline_object_prop` | 🔵 LOW | Object or array literals in JSX props create a new reference on every render, causing unnecessary re-renders of children. |
| REACT_008 | `missing_error_boundary` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Components that fetch data or render user content should be wrapped in an error boundary. |
| REACT_009 | `uselayouteffect_misuse` | 🔵 LOW | useLayoutEffect runs synchronously after DOM mutations, blocking paint. Use useEffect unless you need DOM measurements. |
| REACT_010 | `prop_spreading_dom` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Spreading unknown props onto DOM elements passes invalid HTML attributes, causing React warnings and potential XSS. |
| REACT_011 | `missing_useeffect_cleanup` | 🟡 MEDIUM | useEffect with subscriptions, timers, or event listeners must return a cleanup function to prevent memory leaks. |
| REACT_012 | `missing_suspense_boundary` | 🟠 HIGH | Components using useSuspense, lazy(), or use() must be wrapped in a <Suspense> boundary. |
| REACT_013 | `react_missing_key` | 🟠 HIGH | List items rendered without a stable key prop cause incorrect reconciliation and DOM mutations. |
| REACT_014 | `react_index_key` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Using array index as React key prop causes incorrect reconciliation when items are added, removed, or reordered. |
| REACT_015 | `use_callback_missing_dep` | 🟠 HIGH | useCallback with missing dependencies will use stale closure values instead of the latest state/props. |
| REACT_016 | `react_memo_overuse` | 🔵 LOW | Wrapping every component in React.memo adds comparison overhead and complexity without benefit when props change often. |
| REACT_017 | `state_update_unmounted` | 🟠 HIGH | Calling setState on an unmounted component causes memory leaks and 'Can\'t perform state update on unmounted component' warnings. |
| REACT_018 | `react_children_prop_type` | 🔵 LOW | Using ReactNode instead of PropsWithChildren<T> or FC<T> for components that accept children is less idiomatic. |
| REACT_019 | `conditional_hook_call` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Hooks called inside conditionals, loops, or early returns violate Rules of Hooks and cause crashes. |
| REACT_020 | `event_handler_async` | 🟠 HIGH | Async event handlers without error handling cause unhandled promise rejections that silently swallow errors. |
| REACT_021 | `prop_drilling_deep` | 🔵 LOW | Passing props through 4+ levels of components (prop drilling) is a strong signal to use Context or a state manager. |
| REACT_022 | `large_component` | 🔵 LOW | Components over 200 lines mix too many concerns — break into smaller focused components. |
| REACT_023 | `usememo_stable_primitive` | 🔵 LOW | Wrapping primitive values in useMemo provides no benefit — only memoize expensive computations or object references. |
| REACT_024 | `fragment_wrapper_unnecessary` | 🔵 LOW | Returning a single element wrapped in <></> or <React.Fragment> is unnecessary boilerplate. |
| REACT_025 | `use_id_for_a11y` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Generating DOM IDs with Math.random() or counters is unstable in SSR and should use React's useId() hook. |
| REACT_026 | `dangerouslysetmlhtml_usage` | 🔴 BLOCKER | dangerouslySetInnerHTML with unescaped user content is a direct XSS vulnerability. |
| REACT_027 | `use_transition_missing` | 🔵 LOW | Expensive state updates that cause UI freezes should use startTransition to keep the UI responsive. |
| REACT_028 | `ref_as_state` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Using useRef to store values that should trigger re-renders misses the purpose of refs vs state. |
| REACT_029 | `portal_missing_container` | 🟡 MEDIUM | ReactDOM.createPortal should render into a DOM container that exists before mount — not document.body directly. |
| REACT_030 | `effect_on_initial_render` | 🟡 MEDIUM | useEffect with an empty dependency array that sets visible state causes a flash of incorrect content (FOIC). |
| REACT_031 | `async_missing_error_boundary` | 🟠 HIGH | Async data-fetching components without an error boundary crash the entire component tree on failure. |
| REACT_032 | `debounce_missing_on_search` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Search/autocomplete inputs without debouncing fire an API request on every keystroke, overloading the server. |
| NEXT_001 | `next_router_in_app` | 🟠 HIGH | `next/router` is for the Pages Router. Use `next/navigation` for the App Router. |
| NEXT_002 | `getserversideprops_in_app` | 🟠 HIGH | `getServerSideProps` is a Pages Router API. In the App Router, data fetching is done in Server Components. |
| NEXT_003 | `cookies_in_client_component` | 🔴 BLOCKER | `cookies()` and `headers()` from next/headers cannot be called in Client Components. |
| NEXT_004 | `params_not_awaited` | 🟠 HIGH | In Next.js 15+, `params` and `searchParams` are Promises and must be awaited before destructuring. |
| NEXT_005 | `server_action_no_directive` | 🟠 HIGH | Server Actions must include the `"use server"` directive to prevent accidental client execution. |
| NEXT_006 | `redirect_in_try_catch` | 🟠 HIGH | `redirect()` from next/navigation throws an error internally — catching it prevents the redirect. |
| NEXT_007 | `nextpublic_env_in_server` | 🟡 MEDIUM | NEXT_PUBLIC_ env vars are embedded in the client bundle. Reading them in server code is misleading and may over-expose values. |
| NEXT_008 | `image_missing_alt` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Next.js <Image> components must include an `alt` prop for accessibility and SEO. |
| NEXT_009 | `missing_revalidate` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Server mutations (create/update/delete) should call revalidatePath or revalidateTag to bust the Next.js cache. |
| NEXT_010 | `usesearchparams_no_suspense` | 🟠 HIGH | `useSearchParams()` must be wrapped in a Suspense boundary or it causes a build-time error in Next.js. |
| NEXT_011 | `fetch_no_cache_directive` | 🔵 LOW | Next.js extends fetch with cache control. Fetches in Server Components without explicit cache directives use the default behavior. |
| NEXT_012 | `server_only_in_client` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Importing 'server-only' packages in Client Components leaks server logic to the browser bundle. |
| NEXT_013 | `missing_loading_boundary` | ⚪ TECH_DEBT | Route segments with async data fetching should have a `loading.tsx` for streaming UX. |
| NEXT_014 | `missing_error_page` | ⚪ TECH_DEBT | App Router route segments without `error.tsx` show a generic unhandled error to users. |
| NEXT_015 | `fetch_in_client_component` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Direct fetch() calls in Client Components bypass Next.js caching, run in the browser, and expose API logic. |
| NEXT_016 | `use_server_top_level_only` | 🟠 HIGH | 'use server' directive must appear at the top of a file or function body — not mid-file. |
| NEXT_017 | `streaming_suspense_missing` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Async Server Components that fetch data should be wrapped in Suspense to enable streaming. |
| NEXT_018 | `metadata_static_missing` | 🔵 LOW | Pages without exported metadata or generateMetadata miss SEO — title, description, og:image are indexed by search engines. |
| NEXT_019 | `client_component_at_root` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Marking an entire page or layout 'use client' when only a small part needs interactivity defeats Server Component benefits. |
| NEXT_020 | `fetch_no_cache` | 🔵 LOW | fetch() in Server Components without a cache option opts into Next.js's default caching which may be stale. |
| NEXT_021 | `error_boundary_missing_page` | 🟠 HIGH | Next.js App Router pages without an error.tsx sibling have no error boundary — unhandled errors crash the entire segment. |
| NEXT_022 | `parallel_routes_loading` | 🔵 LOW | Next.js parallel routes (@slot) should have loading.tsx to avoid blocking the entire layout. |
| NEXT_023 | `redirect_in_server_action` | 🟠 HIGH | redirect() from 'next/navigation' called inside try/catch in a Server Action is swallowed — it throws internally. |
| NEXT_024 | `cookies_in_server_component` | 🔵 LOW | cookies() from 'next/headers' makes a Server Component dynamic — use it only when you need per-request values. |
| NEXT_025 | `image_component_missing` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Using <img> instead of Next.js <Image> skips automatic WebP conversion, lazy loading, and size optimization. |
| NEXT_026 | `link_prefetch_opt_out` | 🔵 LOW | Setting prefetch={false} on <Link> disables route prefetching — use sparingly and only for heavyweight routes. |
| NEXT_027 | `server_action_no_revalidate` | 🟠 HIGH | Server Actions that mutate data should call revalidatePath or revalidateTag to clear stale cache. |
| NEXT_028 | `generate_static_params_missing` | 🔵 LOW | Dynamic routes ([slug]) without generateStaticParams are always server-rendered — missing the SSG optimization. |
| NEXT_029 | `middleware_response_clone` | 🟠 HIGH | Cloning or consuming the request body in Next.js Middleware is not supported in Edge Runtime. |
| NEXT_030 | `use_client_on_layout` | 🟠 HIGH | Marking a layout.tsx as 'use client' prevents Server Component children from fetching data on the server. |
| NEXT_031 | `searchparams_missing_type` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Accessing searchParams without type-safe parsing allows injecting unexpected values through the URL. |
| NEXT_032 | `not_found_trigger` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Returning null or an empty component when an entity is not found should call notFound() instead. |
| NEXT_033 | `dynamic_config_missing` | 🔵 LOW | Pages that call dynamic functions (headers, cookies) without 'export const dynamic' may behave differently in production. |
| NEXT_034 | `api_route_in_app_dir` | 🔵 LOW | Using pages/api/ routes alongside App Router is fine, but Route Handlers (app/api/) are preferred for new routes. |
| NEXT_035 | `loading_ui_granularity` | 🔵 LOW | A single loading.tsx for an entire segment is less optimal than Suspense boundaries around individual data-fetching components. |
| NEXT_036 | `form_action_vs_server_action` | 🔵 LOW | HTML <form action="/api/..."> submits as a full page reload. Use Server Actions for progressive enhancement. |
| NEXT_037 | `font_optimization_missing` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Importing fonts from Google Fonts CDN directly bypasses Next.js font optimization (no layout shift, self-hosting). |
| NEXT_038 | `next_middleware_only_auth` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Authentication enforced only in Next.js middleware — bypassable via x-middleware-subrequest header (CVE-2025-29927, CVSS 9.1). |
| NEXT_039 | `next_middleware_subrequest_not_stripped` | 🔴 BLOCKER | x-middleware-subrequest header not stripped at edge/proxy — CVE-2025-29927 bypass. |
| NEXT_040 | `next_no_security_headers` | 🟠 HIGH | next.config has no security headers — missing X-Frame-Options, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options. |
| NEXT_041 | `next_server_action_no_csrf` | 🟠 HIGH | Next.js Server Action exposed without CSRF validation. |
| NEXT_042 | `next_revalidate_unprotected` | 🟠 HIGH | revalidatePath or revalidateTag callable from an unauthenticated route. |

| NEXT_044 | `next_dynamic_route_no_type_coercion` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Dynamic route param used as number/ID without explicit type coercion and validation. |
| NEXT_045 | `next_server_component_cookie_no_boundary` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Server Component reads cookies() without error boundary — unhandled cookie access errors crash the component. |
| NEXT_046 | `next_image_no_domains` | 🟡 MEDIUM | Next.js Image component loads from external src without configuring allowed domains. |
| NEXT_047 | `next_env_public_secret` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Secret or private key stored in NEXT_PUBLIC_ environment variable — exposed to client bundle. |
| AI_001 | `ai_key_in_client` | 🔴 BLOCKER | LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.) must never be loaded in Client Components or browser-visible code. |
| AI_002 | `prompt_injection_risk` | 🟠 HIGH | User input passed directly to LLM messages without sanitization enables prompt injection attacks. |
| AI_003 | `llm_response_as_html` | 🔴 BLOCKER | Rendering raw LLM output as HTML (innerHTML, dangerouslySetInnerHTML) enables XSS via prompt injection. |
| AI_004 | `llm_no_max_tokens` | 🟡 MEDIUM | LLM API calls without max_tokens/maxTokens limits expose you to runaway costs from large completions. |
| AI_005 | `llm_no_timeout` | 🟡 MEDIUM | LLM API calls without a timeout or AbortController signal can hang indefinitely on model overload. |
| AI_006 | `ai_no_rate_limit` | 🟠 HIGH | AI-powered endpoints without rate limiting expose you to cost amplification attacks. |
| AI_007 | `pii_to_external_llm` | 🟠 HIGH | Sending PII (emails, names, SSNs, phone numbers) to external LLM APIs violates data privacy obligations. |
| AI_008 | `streaming_no_error_handler` | 🟡 MEDIUM | LLM streaming responses without error handling leave partial streams unresolved on network errors. |
| AI_009 | `llm_json_parse_unsafe` | 🟠 HIGH | JSON.parse on LLM completion output without try-catch will crash when the model returns non-JSON text. |
| AI_010 | `ai_tool_no_validation` | 🟠 HIGH | AI tool/function call arguments must be validated with a schema before use — the model can hallucinate invalid args. |
| AI_011 | `system_prompt_hardcoded` | 🔵 LOW | System prompts hardcoded in source files are hard to update, version, and audit. |
| AI_012 | `ai_feature_no_fallback` | 🟡 MEDIUM | AI-powered features without a fallback degrade entirely when the LLM API is unavailable. |

| TRPC_015 | `trpc_procedure_too_long` | 🔵 LOW | Procedure resolvers over 50 lines are doing too much — extract business logic into service functions. |
| TRPC_016 | `trpc_cors_wildcard` | 🔴 BLOCKER | tRPC handler with CORS origin: "*" allows any website to call your API with credentials. |

| TRPC_025 | `trpc_missing_zod_import` | 🔵 LOW | tRPC files importing validation schemas should import directly from "zod" for tree-shaking. |
| PRISMA_001 | `prisma_findmany_no_limit` | 🟠 HIGH | prisma.findMany() without a take limit returns the full table — catastrophic on large datasets. |
| PRISMA_002 | `prisma_n_plus_one` | 🟠 HIGH | Fetching related records inside a loop is an N+1 query — use include or select to eager-load. |

## MEDIUM / LOW / TECH_DEBT

**[TS_001] `any_type_no_comment`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Avoid TypeScript `any` without an explanatory comment. Use `unknown` and narrow the type instead.

**[QUAL_001] `console_log`** — 🔵 LOW

Remove console.log statements before merging. Use structured logging in production code.

**[QUAL_002] `large_file`** — ⚪ TECH_DEBT

Files exceeding the configured line threshold are tech-debt candidates. Consider splitting into smaller modules.

**[TEST_001] `missing_test_for_risky_change`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Risky file changes (matching riskyFilePatterns) must include a corresponding test file change in the same diff.

**[DS_001] `design_system_bypass`** — 🔵 LOW

Hardcoded colour literals or raw CSS values outside design-system files bypass the design token system.

**[COMP_001] `duplicate_component_pattern`** — ⚪ TECH_DEBT

Creating a component that duplicates an existing shared UI component. Reuse or extend instead.

**[SEC_008] `hardcoded_http_url`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Hardcoded http:// (non-HTTPS) URLs in production code expose data to network interception.

**[SEC_013] `json_parse_user_input`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

JSON.parse on user-supplied input without try-catch causes unhandled exceptions on malformed JSON.

**[SEC_032] `dependency_confusion`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

**[SEC_034] `clickjacking_missing`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Pages without X-Frame-Options or CSP frame-ancestors are vulnerable to clickjacking.

**[SEC_043] `cors_long_preflight_cache`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

CORS preflight max-age exceeds 1 week — permission changes take days to propagate.

**[TS_002] `ts_ignore_no_comment`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

@ts-ignore suppresses TypeScript errors without explaining why. Always add a justification comment.

**[TS_003] `ts_expect_error_no_comment`** — 🔵 LOW

@ts-expect-error without an explanation comment obscures intentional type suppressions.

**[TS_005] `double_cast`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

`as unknown as T` double casts bypass TypeScript's type system entirely. This masks type errors.

**[TS_006] `function_type`** — 🔵 LOW

Using `Function` as a type is too broad — it accepts any callable including constructors with wrong signatures.

**[TS_007] `var_declaration`** — 🔵 LOW

`var` has function scope and hoisting behavior that causes subtle bugs. Use `const` or `let`.

**[TS_009] `number_parse_no_validate`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Number() and parseInt() on user input return NaN for non-numeric strings. Always validate after parsing.

**[TS_012] `unhandled_error_in_catch`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Using catch(err) with `console.error` only and no re-throw or user notification swallows errors.

**[ASYNC_002] `promise_all_no_catch`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Promise.all() rejects immediately when any promise rejects — handle rejections explicitly.

**[ASYNC_003] `async_no_try_catch`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

API route handlers that are async and use await without try-catch let errors crash the process.

**[ASYNC_004] `new_promise_constructor`** — 🔵 LOW

`new Promise()` wrapping an already-async function loses error propagation and adds unnecessary indirection.

**[ASYNC_005] `sequential_await`** — 🔵 LOW

Multiple sequential awaits for independent operations — use Promise.all for parallel execution.

**[ASYNC_006] `settimeout_zero`** — 🔵 LOW

setTimeout(fn, 0) is a code smell — it defers execution to next tick to work around a timing bug.

**[TS_013] `type_assertion_double_cast`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Double type assertion (x as unknown as T) is a red flag that the types are fundamentally incompatible.

**[TS_014] `missing_return_type`** — 🔵 LOW

Exported functions without explicit return types make API contracts unclear and allow accidental type widening.

**[TS_015] `generic_constraint_missing`** — 🔵 LOW

Generic type parameters without constraints (<T>) accept any type, defeating the purpose of generics.

**[TS_016] `optional_chain_without_fallback`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Optional chaining (a?.b) returning undefined in places that expect a value causes silent runtime failures.

**[TS_017] `non_null_assertion_overuse`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Excessive non-null assertions (!) hide null-reference errors that would otherwise be caught at compile time.

**[TS_018] `discriminated_union_missing`** — 🔵 LOW

Using string/boolean flags to model variants instead of discriminated unions makes impossible states possible.

**[TS_019] `object_destructure_unused`** — 🔵 LOW

Destructuring many properties but using only one is wasteful — destructure only what you need.

**[TS_020] `template_literal_type_missing`** — 🔵 LOW

Using string for URL paths, event names, or CSS classes loses IDE autocomplete and typo safety.

**[TS_021] `readonly_missing`** — 🔵 LOW

Config objects and DTO props without readonly can be accidentally mutated by consumers.

**[TS_022] `enum_prefer_const_object`** — 🔵 LOW

TypeScript enums should be replaced with as const objects for better tree-shaking and bundler compatibility.

**[TS_023] `type_predicate_missing`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Type narrowing functions without type predicates (x is Type) don't narrow the type in the calling scope.

**[TS_024] `satisfies_operator_missing`** — 🔵 LOW

Using as Type instead of satisfies Type loses excess property checking and auto-inference of literal types.

**[TS_025] `index_signature_unsafe`** — 🔵 LOW

Index signatures (Record<string, T>) skip excess property checking and allow any string key.

**[TS_026] `mapped_type_opportunity`** — 🔵 LOW

Repeating the same property pattern across multiple types is a signal for a mapped type.

**[TS_027] `string_union_too_wide`** — 🔵 LOW

String union types with 10+ members become hard to maintain — consider using a const array and typeof.

**[TS_028] `infer_keyword_avoid`** — 🔵 LOW

Overusing conditional types with infer makes code unreadable — prefer utility types when possible.

**[TS_029] `namespace_avoid`** — 🔵 LOW

TypeScript namespaces (namespace Foo {}) are legacy — use ES modules (import/export) instead.

**[TS_030] `excessive_type_assertion`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

More than 5 type assertions in a single file indicates underlying type errors being suppressed rather than fixed.

**[REACT_002] `key_prop_index`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

**[REACT_003] `direct_dom_manipulation`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

document.getElementById and querySelector in React components bypass the virtual DOM.

**[REACT_006] `react_fc_type`** — 🔵 LOW

`React.FC` is discouraged — it implicitly adds children and hides component return type issues.

**[REACT_007] `inline_object_prop`** — 🔵 LOW

Object or array literals in JSX props create a new reference on every render, causing unnecessary re-renders of children.

**[REACT_008] `missing_error_boundary`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Components that fetch data or render user content should be wrapped in an error boundary.

**[REACT_009] `uselayouteffect_misuse`** — 🔵 LOW

useLayoutEffect runs synchronously after DOM mutations, blocking paint. Use useEffect unless you need DOM measurements.

**[REACT_010] `prop_spreading_dom`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Spreading unknown props onto DOM elements passes invalid HTML attributes, causing React warnings and potential XSS.

**[REACT_011] `missing_useeffect_cleanup`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

useEffect with subscriptions, timers, or event listeners must return a cleanup function to prevent memory leaks.

**[REACT_014] `react_index_key`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Using array index as React key prop causes incorrect reconciliation when items are added, removed, or reordered.

**[REACT_016] `react_memo_overuse`** — 🔵 LOW

Wrapping every component in React.memo adds comparison overhead and complexity without benefit when props change often.

**[REACT_018] `react_children_prop_type`** — 🔵 LOW

Using ReactNode instead of PropsWithChildren<T> or FC<T> for components that accept children is less idiomatic.

**[REACT_021] `prop_drilling_deep`** — 🔵 LOW

Passing props through 4+ levels of components (prop drilling) is a strong signal to use Context or a state manager.

**[REACT_022] `large_component`** — 🔵 LOW

Components over 200 lines mix too many concerns — break into smaller focused components.

**[REACT_023] `usememo_stable_primitive`** — 🔵 LOW

Wrapping primitive values in useMemo provides no benefit — only memoize expensive computations or object references.

**[REACT_024] `fragment_wrapper_unnecessary`** — 🔵 LOW

Returning a single element wrapped in <></> or <React.Fragment> is unnecessary boilerplate.

**[REACT_025] `use_id_for_a11y`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Generating DOM IDs with Math.random() or counters is unstable in SSR and should use React's useId() hook.

**[REACT_027] `use_transition_missing`** — 🔵 LOW

Expensive state updates that cause UI freezes should use startTransition to keep the UI responsive.

**[REACT_028] `ref_as_state`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Using useRef to store values that should trigger re-renders misses the purpose of refs vs state.

**[REACT_029] `portal_missing_container`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

ReactDOM.createPortal should render into a DOM container that exists before mount — not document.body directly.

**[REACT_030] `effect_on_initial_render`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

useEffect with an empty dependency array that sets visible state causes a flash of incorrect content (FOIC).

**[REACT_032] `debounce_missing_on_search`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Search/autocomplete inputs without debouncing fire an API request on every keystroke, overloading the server.

**[NEXT_007] `nextpublic_env_in_server`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

NEXT_PUBLIC_ env vars are embedded in the client bundle. Reading them in server code is misleading and may over-expose values.

**[NEXT_008] `image_missing_alt`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Next.js <Image> components must include an `alt` prop for accessibility and SEO.

**[NEXT_009] `missing_revalidate`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Server mutations (create/update/delete) should call revalidatePath or revalidateTag to bust the Next.js cache.

**[NEXT_011] `fetch_no_cache_directive`** — 🔵 LOW

Next.js extends fetch with cache control. Fetches in Server Components without explicit cache directives use the default behavior.

**[NEXT_013] `missing_loading_boundary`** — ⚪ TECH_DEBT

Route segments with async data fetching should have a `loading.tsx` for streaming UX.

**[NEXT_014] `missing_error_page`** — ⚪ TECH_DEBT

App Router route segments without `error.tsx` show a generic unhandled error to users.

**[NEXT_015] `fetch_in_client_component`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Direct fetch() calls in Client Components bypass Next.js caching, run in the browser, and expose API logic.

**[NEXT_017] `streaming_suspense_missing`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Async Server Components that fetch data should be wrapped in Suspense to enable streaming.

**[NEXT_018] `metadata_static_missing`** — 🔵 LOW

Pages without exported metadata or generateMetadata miss SEO — title, description, og:image are indexed by search engines.

**[NEXT_019] `client_component_at_root`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Marking an entire page or layout 'use client' when only a small part needs interactivity defeats Server Component benefits.

**[NEXT_020] `fetch_no_cache`** — 🔵 LOW

fetch() in Server Components without a cache option opts into Next.js's default caching which may be stale.

**[NEXT_022] `parallel_routes_loading`** — 🔵 LOW

Next.js parallel routes (@slot) should have loading.tsx to avoid blocking the entire layout.

**[NEXT_024] `cookies_in_server_component`** — 🔵 LOW

cookies() from 'next/headers' makes a Server Component dynamic — use it only when you need per-request values.

**[NEXT_025] `image_component_missing`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Using <img> instead of Next.js <Image> skips automatic WebP conversion, lazy loading, and size optimization.

**[NEXT_026] `link_prefetch_opt_out`** — 🔵 LOW

Setting prefetch={false} on <Link> disables route prefetching — use sparingly and only for heavyweight routes.

**[NEXT_028] `generate_static_params_missing`** — 🔵 LOW

Dynamic routes ([slug]) without generateStaticParams are always server-rendered — missing the SSG optimization.

**[NEXT_031] `searchparams_missing_type`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Accessing searchParams without type-safe parsing allows injecting unexpected values through the URL.

**[NEXT_032] `not_found_trigger`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Returning null or an empty component when an entity is not found should call notFound() instead.

**[NEXT_033] `dynamic_config_missing`** — 🔵 LOW

Pages that call dynamic functions (headers, cookies) without 'export const dynamic' may behave differently in production.

**[NEXT_034] `api_route_in_app_dir`** — 🔵 LOW

Using pages/api/ routes alongside App Router is fine, but Route Handlers (app/api/) are preferred for new routes.

**[NEXT_035] `loading_ui_granularity`** — 🔵 LOW

A single loading.tsx for an entire segment is less optimal than Suspense boundaries around individual data-fetching components.

**[NEXT_036] `form_action_vs_server_action`** — 🔵 LOW

HTML <form action="/api/..."> submits as a full page reload. Use Server Actions for progressive enhancement.

**[NEXT_037] `font_optimization_missing`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Importing fonts from Google Fonts CDN directly bypasses Next.js font optimization (no layout shift, self-hosting).

**[NEXT_043] `next_route_no_content_type_check`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

POST route handler processes body without validating Content-Type header.

**[NEXT_044] `next_dynamic_route_no_type_coercion`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Dynamic route param used as number/ID without explicit type coercion and validation.

**[NEXT_045] `next_server_component_cookie_no_boundary`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

LLM API calls without max_tokens/maxTokens limits expose you to runaway costs from large completions.

**[AI_005] `llm_no_timeout`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

LLM API calls without a timeout or AbortController signal can hang indefinitely on model overload.

**[AI_008] `streaming_no_error_handler`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

LLM streaming responses without error handling leave partial streams unresolved on network errors.

**[AI_011] `system_prompt_hardcoded`** — 🔵 LOW

**[AI_012] `ai_feature_no_fallback`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

AI-powered features without a fallback degrade entirely when the LLM API is unavailable.

**[AI_015] `streaming_not_used`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

LLM completions for UI should stream responses to give users immediate feedback instead of waiting for the full response.

RAG-powered answers should cite source documents so users can verify accuracy and avoid hallucination trust.

**[AI_024] `model_hardcoded`** — 🔵 LOW

Hardcoding a specific LLM model string prevents easy upgrades and A/B testing.

**[AI_025] `prompt_version_untracked`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Production prompts without versioning make it impossible to know which prompt was active when a regression occurred.

**[AI_026] `ai_retry_no_backoff`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

LLM API calls without retry/backoff logic will fail immediately on transient rate limit errors.

**[AI_036] `ai_hallucination_no_grounding`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

LLM used for factual queries without retrieval grounding — misinformation risk (OWASP LLM09).

**[AI_037] `ai_model_not_pinned`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Regex literals created inside function bodies are recompiled on every call. Move to module scope.

**[PERF_004] `select_star`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

`SELECT *` fetches all columns including unused ones, wasting bandwidth, memory, and preventing index-only scans.

**[PERF_005] `large_bundle_import`** — 🔵 LOW

Importing an entire package when only one function is needed increases bundle size unnecessarily.

**[PERF_006] `missing_pagination`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

List queries without LIMIT/take/pagination return unbounded result sets that grow with data volume.

**[PERF_007] `json_in_loop`** — 🔵 LOW

`JSON.stringify` or `JSON.parse` inside a loop reserializes data on every iteration — compute once outside.

**[PERF_008] `missing_db_index`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Querying a column without an index causes a full table scan on every request.

**[A11Y_004] `autofocus_attribute`** — 🔵 LOW

autoFocus moves focus on mount without warning, disorienting screen reader and keyboard users.

**[A11Y_005] `positive_tabindex`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

**[A11Y_007] `link_no_descriptive_text`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Links with text "click here", "read more", or "learn more" provide no context out of screen reader focus.

**[PERF_009] `bundle_size_moment`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Complex regex compiled inside a loop or function body wastes CPU recompiling on every call.

**[PERF_014] `json_parse_large`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

JSON.parse() on large strings blocks the main thread — use streaming or a Web Worker for large payloads.

**[PERF_015] `event_listener_passive`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Scroll and touch event listeners without { passive: true } block the browser's compositor thread, causing scroll jank.

**[PERF_016] `intersection_observer_missing`** — 🔵 LOW

Using scroll listeners to detect element visibility should use IntersectionObserver instead.

**[PERF_017] `object_spread_in_render`** — 🔵 LOW

Querying a soft-delete table without filtering deleted_at returns deleted records as if they were active.

**[DB_006] `unlimited_query_result`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Queries returning all rows from a table without LIMIT will degrade as data grows.

**[DB_007] `migration_no_rollback`** — 🔵 LOW

Migrations without a rollback (down migration) cannot be reverted safely in production incidents.

**[API_007] `missing_idempotency`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Non-idempotent POST endpoints for payments or orders without idempotency key support may cause duplicate charges on retry.

**[DB_011] `select_star_prisma`** — 🔵 LOW

Selecting all fields with findMany() when only a subset is needed sends excess data over the wire.

**[DB_013] `soft_delete_missing`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Using String instead of a database enum for finite-state fields loses type safety and allows invalid values.

**[DB_028] `db_abort_controller_missing`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Sequential async fetch chain without AbortController — stale responses from cancelled requests corrupt state.

**[DB_029] `db_sequential_await_in_loop`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Sequential `await` in a loop instead of `Promise.all` — unnecessary serialization and potential race-free alternative.

**[DB_031] `db_shared_state_no_atomicity`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Event handler or callback updates shared mutable state without atomicity — lost update under concurrent execution.

**[QUAL_003] `todo_in_production`** — 🔵 LOW

TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in production code represent unresolved work that should be a tracked issue.

**[QUAL_004] `magic_number`** — 🔵 LOW

Unexplained numeric literals make intent invisible and create maintenance hazards.

`console.log` in production source files leaks internal state and adds noise to observability pipelines.

**[QUAL_008] `hardcoded_env_url`** — 🔵 LOW

Base URLs hardcoded in source should be environment variables so they can change between environments.

**[TEST_003] `test_skip_no_reason`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

`it.skip` / `test.skip` without a comment or issue reference hides forgotten disabled tests.

**[TEST_006] `nondeterministic_test_fixture`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

`Math.random()` or `Date.now()` in test fixtures produce different data on every run — tests become flaky.

**[TEST_007] `snapshot_only_test`** — 🔵 LOW

Tests that only assert a snapshot do not describe intent and break on any render change.

**[TEST_008] `console_in_test`** — 🔵 LOW

`console.log` in tests adds noise to test output and hides the signal from failures.

**[GIT_003] `large_binary_committed`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

**[GIT_004] `generated_file_in_source`** — 🔵 LOW

Generated or compiled files committed alongside source code must be regenerated manually when out of date.

**[DEPS_002] `node_modules_import`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Importing directly from `node_modules/` path is fragile and breaks with package manager changes.

**[DEPS_003] `barrel_import_server_hot_path`** — 🔵 LOW

Barrel imports (index.ts re-exports) in server hot paths import every export even if only one is needed.

**[ZOD_002] `zod_any_type`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

z.any() defeats the purpose of Zod validation. Use a specific schema or z.unknown() with type narrowing.

**[ZOD_003] `zod_string_max_missing`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

String fields without .max() are an unbounded-input DoS risk. Always cap user-supplied strings.

**[ZOD_005] `zod_refine_no_message`** — 🔵 LOW

.refine() without a custom error message produces cryptic "Invalid input" errors in API responses.

**[ZOD_006] `zod_schema_in_component`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Defining Zod schemas inside React components recreates them on every render, wasting CPU and breaking referential equality.

**[ZOD_007] `zod_email_no_trim`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Email validation without .trim() passes "  user@example.com  " as valid, causing login mismatches.

**[ZOD_010] `zod_array_no_maxlength`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Arrays without .max() allow unbounded-size payloads — memory exhaustion DoS.

**[ZOD_012] `zod_uuid_field_missing`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

ID fields typed as z.string() instead of z.string().uuid() allow any string to be passed as an identifier.

**[ZOD_013] `zod_no_infer`** — 🔵 LOW

Defining TypeScript types separately from Zod schemas creates drift. Use z.infer<typeof Schema>.

**[ZOD_014] `zod_enum_not_const`** — 🔵 LOW

Inline z.enum(["a","b","c"]) literals should be extracted to a const tuple for reuse in TypeScript.

**[ZOD_015] `zod_object_strict_missing`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Input schemas that process sensitive operations should use .strict() to reject unknown fields.

**[ZOD_016] `zod_number_not_int`** — 🔵 LOW

Count/quantity/pagination fields should use .int() to reject 1.5 or NaN.

**[ZOD_018] `zod_date_no_range`** — 🔵 LOW

Date fields without min/max constraints accept epoch dates or dates far in the future, causing data integrity issues.

**[ZOD_020] `zod_unsafe_html_string`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

String fields named "content", "body", or "html" without a sanitization note are potential stored-XSS vectors.

**[ZOD_021] `zod_transform_loses_type`** — 🔵 LOW

.transform() that returns a different type changes the inferred schema output type, causing type surprises downstream.

**[ZOD_023] `zod_optional_with_default`** — 🔵 LOW

.optional().default(X) chains are confusing — .default(X) already makes the field optional.

**[ZOD_024] `zod_ip_missing_validation`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

IP address fields typed as plain z.string() allow any string. Use .ip() for validation.

**[ZOD_025] `zod_superrefine_no_ctx`** — 🔵 LOW

**[ZOD_026] `zod_discriminated_union_opportunity`** — 🔵 LOW

z.union() where all variants share a discriminant field should use z.discriminatedUnion() for better errors and performance.

**[ZOD_027] `zod_phone_no_validation`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Phone number fields without format validation accept any string including script tags.

**[TRPC_004] `trpc_console_in_procedure`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

console.log inside tRPC procedures bypasses structured logging and will leak sensitive data in production.

Passing the full tRPC ctx to service functions couples your business logic to the tRPC request context.

**[TRPC_008] `trpc_no_output_schema`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

tRPC procedures without .output() validation can leak fields added to the database model.

**[TRPC_009] `trpc_any_context`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Using any or unknown for the tRPC context type removes all type safety in procedures.

Queries that can return null should throw TRPCError NOT_FOUND instead of returning null to clients.

**[TRPC_011] `trpc_sequential_awaits`** — 🔵 LOW

Sequential independent await calls in tRPC procedures should be parallelized with Promise.all().

**[TRPC_013] `trpc_missing_error_boundary`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

tRPC onError handler not configured — unhandled errors emit raw stack traces to server logs.

**[TRPC_014] `trpc_no_transformer`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

tRPC without a data transformer (superjson) cannot serialize Date, Map, Set, or undefined correctly.

**[TRPC_015] `trpc_procedure_too_long`** — 🔵 LOW

Procedure resolvers over 50 lines are doing too much — extract business logic into service functions.

**[TRPC_018] `trpc_no_abort_signal`** — 🔵 LOW

Long-running tRPC queries should pass the abort signal from the request to cancellable operations.

**[TRPC_024] `trpc_missing_pagination_cursor`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Offset-based pagination (skip/offset) breaks at scale — use cursor-based pagination for reliability.

**[TRPC_025] `trpc_missing_zod_import`** — 🔵 LOW

tRPC files importing validation schemas should import directly from "zod" for tree-shaking.

**[PRISMA_005] `prisma_select_star`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Fetching all fields with findMany/findUnique (no select) returns sensitive fields and wastes bandwidth.

**[PRISMA_010] `prisma_count_no_where`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

prisma.model.count() without a where clause runs a full-table count — expensive on large tables.

**[PRISMA_013] `prisma_in_array_unbounded`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

WHERE IN queries with a potentially large array can exceed database parameter limits or degrade performance.

**[PRISMA_016] `prisma_nested_write_depth`** — 🔵 LOW

Ordering by a column likely missing an index causes full-table sorts on large datasets.

**[PRISMA_027] `prisma_json_no_type`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Json fields in Prisma have no runtime type — store typed data as relational columns or validate at application layer.

**[PRISMA_028] `prisma_middleware_no_error_handling`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Prisma middleware without error handling can silently swallow query failures.

**[PRISMA_029] `prisma_connection_pool_config`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

DATABASE_URL without connection pool sizing parameters may default to too many or too few connections.

**[PRISMA_030] `prisma_enum_not_in_schema`** — 🔵 LOW

String literal unions used for status/type fields should be Prisma enums for DB-level constraint enforcement.

**[NODE_024] `deprecation_buffer_constructor`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

new Buffer() and Buffer() are deprecated — use Buffer.from(), Buffer.alloc(), or Buffer.allocUnsafe().

**[NODE_025] `circular_json_stringify`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

catch blocks that log but do not re-throw or return allow execution to continue in an invalid state.

**[ERR_003] `error_type_not_checked`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

catch (e) without instanceof checks treats all errors the same, including expected cancellation signals.

**[ERR_006] `error_without_context`** — 🔵 LOW

Reassigning the catch variable shadows the original error, making stack traces inaccessible.

**[ERR_017] `sentry_capture_missing`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Production apps without error monitoring (Sentry/Datadog) have no visibility into unhandled exceptions.

**[ERR_018] `validation_error_generic`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Returning generic "Validation failed" without field-level errors forces clients to guess what went wrong.

**[ERR_019] `error_swallowed_in_map`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Errors thrown inside .map() callbacks may be swallowed or cause partial results depending on the context.

**[ERR_021] `error_log_level_mismatch`** — 🔵 LOW

Using logger.warn() for errors that should cause an alert trains on-call engineers to ignore warnings.

**[ERR_022] `unchecked_return_value`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Ignoring return values from operations that signal failure through return (not throw) hides errors.

**[ERR_023] `error_in_constructor`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Async operations in constructors cannot be awaited, hiding initialization errors.

**[ERR_024] `missing_error_serialization`** — 🟡 MEDIUM

Sending Error objects in JSON responses requires explicit serialization — Error.toJSON() is not automatic.

Importing from barrel files (index.ts) prevents tree-shaking and inflates bundle size.

**[IMPORT_003] `import_side_effects`** — 🔵 LOW

Side-effect imports (import './polyfill') without comments are confusing to readers and bundlers.
