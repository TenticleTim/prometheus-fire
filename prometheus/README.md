**One rule registry. Every AI assistant. Zero duplication.**

Prometheus is a repo governance tool for TypeScript projects. Define your code review rules once, then automatically generate instruction files for Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, and `AGENTS.md` — keeping every AI assistant on your team in sync. Gate CI on violations, score your codebase health, and give every AI a complete picture of how your repo works.

---

## Why Prometheus?

Without governance, every AI assistant in your team invents its own rules. Claude follows one convention, Cursor follows another, Copilot knows nothing about your auth patterns. Every PR review is inconsistent. Governance debt compounds silently.

Prometheus solves this with a **single source of truth**: 911 rules defined once, propagated everywhere.

## Get started in 60 seconds

```bash
# Install
npm install --save-dev prometheus-governance

# Scaffold the governance folder + GitHub Actions workflow
npx prometheus init

# Analyse your repo
npx prometheus scan

# Generate AI assistant instruction files
npx prometheus adapters

# Review changed files (compare against main)
npx prometheus review --base=main

# Gate CI — exits 1 on BLOCKER findings
npx prometheus validate --base=origin/main
```

That's it. You now have:

- `.prometheus/` — governance folder with rules, config, and AI context
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules/prometheus.mdc`, and more — auto-generated adapter files
- `.github/workflows/prometheus-review.yml` — CI workflow ready to go

  }
}
```

**Node.js 20 or later is required.**

---

## Commands

All commands support `--json`, `--markdown`, and `--dry-run` flags where applicable.

### `prometheus init`

Scaffolds or updates the `.prometheus/` governance folder.

```bash
npx prometheus init
npx prometheus init --dry-run    # preview without writing
```

**Creates:**

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.prometheus/config.json` | Repo-specific config (never overwritten after creation) |
| `.prometheus/GUARDRAILS.md` | Active rules summary |
| `.prometheus/RULES.md` | Full rule reference |
| `.prometheus/governance/CODE_REVIEW.md` | Code review checklist |
| `.prometheus/governance/REVIEW_AGENT.md` | AI agent instructions |
| `.prometheus/governance/SEVERITY_MODEL.md` | Severity levels explained |
| `.github/workflows/prometheus-review.yml` | CI workflow |

---

### `prometheus scan`

Analyses your repo and writes `.prometheus/report.json`. Detects framework, auth system, test setup, API routes, large files, risky patterns, and more.

```bash
npx prometheus scan
npx prometheus scan --json
```

---

### `prometheus review`

Reviews changed files against your rule set. Always exits 0 — use `validate` for CI gating.

```bash
npx prometheus review --base=main
npx prometheus review --base=origin/main --markdown
npx prometheus review src/api/users.ts src/lib/auth.ts
```

---

### `prometheus validate`

Same as `review` but exits 1 when `failOnSeverity` findings are present (default: `BLOCKER`). Use this as your CI gate.

```bash
npx prometheus validate --base=origin/$GITHUB_BASE_REF
```

---

### `prometheus adapters`

Generates AI assistant instruction files from the canonical rule registry. Preserves any content you have written outside `<!-- PROMETHEUS:GENERATED -->` markers.

```bash
npx prometheus adapters
npx prometheus adapters --targets=claude,gemini
```

---

### `prometheus doctor`

Full installation health check: required files, npm scripts, adapter freshness, report age, config validity, IDE dirs, and GitHub workflow.

```bash
npx prometheus doctor
npx prometheus doctor --json
```

---

### `prometheus ci-check`

Lightweight CI gate — checks adapter freshness and required files without re-running the full generator. Faster than `doctor`. Exits 1 on failure.

```bash
npx prometheus ci-check
```

---

### `prometheus health`

Scores your governance posture from 0 to 100 with a letter grade (A+ to F). Combines findings, drift, suppressions, and baseline into a single number.

```bash
npx prometheus health
npx prometheus health --json
```

---

### `prometheus drift`

Detects 12 categories of stale or missing governance artifacts: outdated adapters, missing files, registry mismatches, stale report, and more.

```bash
npx prometheus drift
```

---

### `prometheus explain <rule-id>`

Shows why a rule exists, common violations, good and bad code examples, and related playbooks.

```bash
npx prometheus explain ENV_001
npx prometheus explain direct_env_access
```

---

### `prometheus audit`

Combined `doctor` + scan-based `review`. Always exits 0. Use for broad visibility during development.

```bash
npx prometheus audit --markdown
```

---

### `prometheus fix`

Auto-fixes safe violations. Dry-run by default.

```bash
npx prometheus fix --base=main --dry-run
npx prometheus fix --base=main             # applies changes
```

---

---

## Rule packs

Packs are installable bundles of additional rules, agents, skills, and playbooks. The built-in registry ships 911 rules — packs let the community (and your organisation) add more without forking.

### Installing a pack

```bash
# Local pack — drop a directory into .prometheus/packs/
mkdir -p .prometheus/packs/my-pack
# create .prometheus/packs/my-pack/pack.json + rules/index.js

# npm pack (scoped under @prometheus/)
npm install --save-dev @prometheus/web
```

### Creating a pack

A pack is a directory with a `pack.json` manifest and a `rules/index.js` that exports `PACK_RULES`:

```json
{
  "id": "@myorg/internal",
  "name": "Internal rules",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Company-specific governance rules",
  "author": "My Org",
  "tags": ["internal"],
  "provides": { "rules": true, "agents": false, "skills": false, "playbooks": false, "profiles": false },
  "schemaVersion": "1"
}
```

```javascript
// .prometheus/packs/my-pack/rules/index.js
export const PACK_RULES = [
  {
    id: 'ORG_001',
    category: 'no_direct_db_in_routes',
    description: 'Route handlers must use the service layer — no direct Prisma calls.',
    severity: 'HIGH',
    tags: ['internal', 'architecture'],
    sinceVersion: '1.0.0',
    explain: { why: '...', commonViolations: [], goodExample: '', badExample: '',
                relatedPlaybooks: [], relatedAgents: [], relatedSkills: [] },
    detect({ changedFiles = [] }) {
      // ... return Finding[]
      return [];
    },
  },
];
```

Pack rules are automatically loaded by `prometheus review` and `prometheus validate`. Use `pack:list` and `pack:validate` to inspect what's installed.

---

## GitHub Actions

`prometheus init` writes `.github/workflows/prometheus-review.yml` to your repo. It runs on every pull request:

```text
scan → ci-check → review → validate (gate) → doctor
```

`validate` is the only step that can fail the job. All other steps upload output to a `prometheus-report` artifact.

**Adjust for your package manager:**

| Manager | Install | Run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm | `npm ci` | `npm run` |
| pnpm | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | `pnpm run` |
| yarn | `yarn install --immutable` | `yarn` |
| bun | `bun install` | `bun run` |

---

## Configuration

Edit `.prometheus/config.json` to customise behaviour. The file is created by `prometheus init` and is never overwritten by subsequent runs.

```json
{
  "$schema": "node_modules/prometheus-governance/config.schema.json",
  "project": "My App",
  "failOnSeverity": ["BLOCKER"],
  "warnOnSeverity": ["HIGH"],
  "largeFileThreshold": 300,
  "ignoredFolders": ["node_modules", ".next", "dist"],
  "protectedBranches": ["main"],
  "disabledRules": [],
  "doctor": {
    "reportMaxAgeDays": 7
  }
}
```

Adding `"$schema"` gives you full autocomplete and validation in VS Code and any JSON-Schema-aware editor.

### Severity levels

| Level | Default CI effect | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BLOCKER` | `exit 1` | Security violations, data leaks, broken invariants |
| `HIGH` | Warning | Auth gaps, risky patterns, near-violations |
| `MEDIUM` | Advisory | Type safety, quality issues |
| `LOW` | Advisory | Style, minor cleanup |
| `TECH_DEBT` | Advisory | Large files, complexity debt |

### Disabling rules

```json
{
  "disabledRules": ["GATE_001", "direct_env_access"]
}
```

Use rule IDs (`ENV_001`) or category names (`direct_env_access`). Both are shown in `prometheus explain`.

---

## Adapter targets

Every adapter is generated from the same `PROMETHEUS_RULES` array. You never write rules twice.

| Target | Output path | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code, Claude.ai |
| `gemini` | `GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI, AI Studio |
| `cursor` | `.cursor/rules/prometheus.mdc` | Cursor IDE |
| `copilot` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot |
| `codex` | `.codex/prometheus.md` | OpenAI Codex CLI |
| `agents` | `AGENTS.md` | OpenAI Agents, generic agents |

Adapters embed a `<!-- PROMETHEUS:META -->` comment with `version`, `target`, and `ruleCount`. `prometheus ci-check` reads this metadata to detect drift without re-running the generator — fully deterministic, no timestamps.

Manual content you write outside `<!-- PROMETHEUS:GENERATED START -->` / `<!-- PROMETHEUS:GENERATED END -->` markers is **always preserved** across regenerations.

---

## Health score

`prometheus health` synthesises your governance state into a single number:

```text
prometheus health

  Grade: A  (87/100)

  Deductions
  ✗  2 HIGH findings            -6
  ✗  1 drift event              -4
  ✗  1 suppression missing reason -3

  Bonuses
  ✓  Baseline in use            +5
  ✓  Zero BLOCKER findings      +5
  ✓  Report is fresh            +5
```

Grades: **A+** (95–100) · **A** (85–94) · **B** (75–84) · **C** (65–74) · **D** (50–64) · **F** (<50)

---

## Baseline system

The baseline lets you adopt Prometheus in an existing codebase without failing CI on day one. Snapshot your current debt, then only new violations block CI.

```bash
# Snapshot current findings as known debt
npx prometheus baseline:create --base=main

# After fixing some debt, update the snapshot
npx prometheus baseline:update --base=main

# See what's in the baseline
npx prometheus baseline:report
```

Findings in the baseline are fingerprinted by `(category, file, normalised message)` — they survive file moves and minor edits.

---

## Inline suppressions

Suppress a single violation inline with a required reason:

```typescript
// prometheus-disable-next-line ENV_001 -- reason: legacy pattern, tracked in #4521
const val = process.env.MY_VAR;
```

Optional fields:

```typescript
// prometheus-disable-next-line ENV_001 -- reason: legacy -- owner: @alice -- expires: 2026-12-31
```

Audit all suppressions in the repo:

```bash
npx prometheus suppressions:audit
```

This flags: missing reasons, expired suppressions, blanket disables (no rule ID), and suppressions where the violation no longer exists.

---

## Library API

Import Prometheus programmatically — for VS Code extensions, build tools, or custom scripts:

```typescript
import {
  loadConfig,
  runScanner,
  runReview,
  runDoctorForRoot,
  runCiCheckForRoot,
  exitCodeFor,
  PROMETHEUS_RULES,
} from 'prometheus-governance';

// Load config from .prometheus/config.json
const config = loadConfig(root);

// Analyse repo structure
const scan = await runScanner(root, config);

// Review changed files
const findings = runReview({ scan, config, changedFiles });

// CI exit code (0 or 1)
const code = exitCodeFor(findings, config);

// Health check
const checks = await runDoctorForRoot(root, config);

// Generate adapter content for any target
import { buildAdapterContent } from 'prometheus-governance';
const content = buildAdapterContent('claude', existing, PROMETHEUS_RULES, config);
```

### Key exports

```typescript
// Rules
PROMETHEUS_RULES           // PrometheusRule[] — all 911 built-in rules
getRulesByTag(tag)         // filter by tag
getRulesBySeverity(sev)    // filter by severity
getRulesByCategory(cat)    // filter by category

// Pack rules — merge built-ins with installed packs
getActiveRules(root)       // → Promise<PrometheusRule[]> (built-ins + pack rules)
loadPackRules(root)        // → Promise<PrometheusRule[]> (pack rules only)

// Review
runReview(input, registry) // → Finding[]  (pass getActiveRules() result as registry)
formatFindingsConsole(f)   // → string
formatFindingsMarkdown(f)  // → string
formatFindingsJson(f)      // → string

// Health
computeHealthForRoot(root, config)   // → HealthScore
computeHealthScore(input)            // pure calculation

// Drift
runDriftForRoot(root, config)        // → DriftEvent[]

// Explain
findRule(idOrCategory)               // → PrometheusRule | undefined
listRules()                          // → PrometheusRule[]
formatExplainConsole(rule, findings) // → string
```

Full type definitions are included. Import types with:

```typescript
import type {
  PrometheusConfig,
  ScanResult,
  Finding,
  DoctorCheck,
  Severity,
  PrometheusRule,
} from 'prometheus-governance';
```

---

## How it works

```text
PROMETHEUS_RULES             ← single source of truth (911 built-in rules + pack rules at runtime)
        │
        ├── adapters.ts      → CLAUDE.md · GEMINI.md · .cursor/ · .github/ · .codex/ · AGENTS.md
        ├── init.ts          → .prometheus/ governance folder
        ├── scanner/         → repo analysis → report.json
        ├── review.ts        → per-file findings
        ├── severity.ts      → exit codes (0 | 1)
        ├── doctor.ts        → installation health
        ├── drift.ts         → adapter freshness + 12 drift categories
        ├── health.ts        → 0–100 governance score
        ├── baseline.ts      → known-debt fingerprinting
        └── suppress.ts      → inline suppression parsing + audit
```

**Pure functions throughout.** All detection, formatting, and classification logic has no side effects and is independently testable. I/O is isolated to entry-point functions (`runDoctorForRoot`, `runDriftForRoot`, etc.).

**Zero runtime dependencies.** The entire tool ships with no production dependencies — just Node.js built-ins. This means no supply-chain risk and instant installs.

**Deterministic.** No timestamps in governance artifacts. Sorted output. Injectable `Date` and `fs` in tests. The same inputs always produce the same outputs.
